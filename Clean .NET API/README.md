## ‚ö° Features

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Authentication with Identity Framework
This template pre-configures the Identity Framework with EF Core and maps Identity API Endpoints, enabling you to secure your APIs effortlessly. Explore more about [Identity API Endpoints](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/authentication/identity-api-authorization?view=aspnetcore-8.0#the-mapidentityapituser-endpoints).

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Repository Pattern with EF Core 
Includes a **BaseRepository**, a generic repository containing methods for CRUD operations on data models using EF Core. Easily extend this abstract repository for your models and implement the **Repository Pattern** seamlessly.  

> **üí° Note:** The template uses MySQL Database Provider for EF Core by default. You can switch to any EF Core-supported database provider.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Transaction Filter
Ensure atomic operations with the built-in **Transaction Filter**, guaranteeing **data integrity** for POST, PUT, and DELETE APIs.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Model Validation with FluentValidation
Validate your models effortlessly with pre-configured **FluentValidation**.  
- Includes a **ValidationFilter** to simplify model validation without redundant calls in every action method.  
- Supports **async validation** and includes custom validators for less repetitive configuration.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Exception Middleware
No more sprinkling `try-catch` everywhere! The template includes **Exception Middleware** to centralize exception handling and keep your codebase clean and elegant.

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Automatic Database Migration (Development Mode)
Run your project in development mode, and any pending database migrations are applied automatically.  

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Note:** For production environments, avoid automatic migrations. Instead, apply them manually using [these methods](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/managing-schemas/migrations/applying?tabs=dotnet-core-cli).

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Automapper for Object Mapping
The template integrates **Automapper** to simplify and streamline object mapping, reducing boilerplate code.  

### 8Ô∏è‚É£ Standard Coding Practices
The codebase adheres to best practices:  
- Readable naming conventions.  
- Minimized code repetition.  
- Proper separation of concerns and abstractions.  

This fosters **readability**, **maintainability**, and **scalability**, inspiring users to follow the same high standards! üèÜ
